DCIconverter
============

This is some code for converting RGB images to XYZ and back again.

This all started because people were using my [j2k](http://www.fnordware.com/j2k) plug-in for Premiere Pro to write out [Digital Cinema](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Cinema_Package) frames, which are JPEG 2000 images in XYZ color space. Some questioned the way I was doing my XYZ conversion, so I figured the best thing to do was make the code available for public scrutiny.

So far this project includes a program-independent converter class and an After Effects plug-in that also runs in Premiere Pro.
